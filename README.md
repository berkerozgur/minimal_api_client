# Minimal API Client

A minimal API client for experimenting with HTTP requests. Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods with JSON handling. Built as a lightweight practice project for learning and testingâ€”not intended for production use.

> **Note:** This project is currently intended for desktop platforms only. Mobile and web support are not included at this time, but may be added in the future as the project evolves.
